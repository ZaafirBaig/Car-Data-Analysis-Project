# Car-Data-Analysis-Project
## Project Description
This project involves a detailed analysis of car data to understand the relationship between various attributes such as price, fuel efficiency, aspiration type, and horsepower. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, statistical tests and visualizations are conducted to derive meaningful insights.

## Key Analyses
1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Investigated the correlation between car price and fuel efficiency (both city and highway km/l).

2. **Hypothesis Testing on Aspiration Type:**
   - Conducted a Z-test to compare the mean prices of cars with different aspiration types (standard vs. turbo).

3. **Hypothesis Testing on Fuel Type:**
   - Performed a T-test to compare the mean horsepower of cars with different fuel types (gas vs. diesel).

## Results
1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - The correlation matrix revealed a significant negative correlation between car price and fuel efficiency, indicating that more expensive cars tend to have lower fuel efficiency.

2. **Aspiration Type Hypothesis Test:**
   - The Z-test results indicated a significant difference in mean prices between cars with standard and turbo aspiration, with turbo cars being generally more expensive.

3. **Fuel Type Hypothesis Test:**
   - The T-test results showed no significant difference in mean horsepower between gas and diesel cars.
